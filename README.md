I am building this project to understand the recent trend of programing language preference and the ratio of of new programers. The detailed question I am trying to understand are
1. What is the the proportion of professionals with less than five years of experience in the field?
2. Which programing languages are widely used?
3. What does the trend of languages popularity look like in the past five years?

## File Descriptions <a name="Descriptions"></a>
1. The survey data is i the `survey` folder
2. Before using the data it needs to be extracted - run the notebook `prepareSurvey.ipynb`
